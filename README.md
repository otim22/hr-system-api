    composer require --dev deployer/deployer
 
To initialize deployer in your project run:
    vendor/bin/dep init

Add next alias to your .bashrc file:
    alias dep='vendor/bin/dep'

Now lets cd into the project and run the following command:
    dep init

Check a sample of deploy script in the root project called "deploy.sample.php"

To deploy the project:
    dep deploy

Ssh to the host, for example, for editing .env file:
    dep ssh

**TL;DR command list**  

    composer require --dev deployer/deployer
    
    vendor/bin/dep init
    
    alias dep='vendor/bin/dep'
    
    dep init
    
    dep deploy
